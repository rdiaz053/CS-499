## Enhancement Three: Databases
The artifact I chose to use for my Database enhancement was the data set that was given to me in my DAT 220 class that was used for the final report. The data is a set of customer information that was collected by the company; and it was initially used for data mining. We used JMP in order to analyze the data to check for any statistical significance that could help the company improve their sales and more effectively market their goods. My enhancement plan involves using this data set to create a MongoDB database and create a HTML interface in order to allow users to interact with the data.

I chose to use this artifact as my enhancement because it allows me to do something the other enhancements did not, build my own product in order to showcase data from another class. I also wanted to build on my initial knowledge from CS 340. The final project form CS 340 required us to use MongoDB to store a data set and then create a RESTful API in order to allow the user to access the data and view it based on a set of parameters. The final project used a command line interface and was implanted using Python. For my enhancement, I will use Express which is a Node.js web application framework to implement the RESTful API.

This enhancement was a bit more difficult than the others for the simple fact that I was going to have to do a lot of my own research and teaching in order to properly fulfill my enhancement. Iâ€™ve used MongoDB and REST APIs before, but only within a certain parameter. I also have knowledge with Javascript and CSS, but in order to complete my objectives, I had to learn how to use Jade, which is considered to be an obscure programming language. I spent a lot of time researching prior to actually beginning work on the enhancement which in turn, worked out in my favor because I got to learn quite a lot.
