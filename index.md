# CS-499 ePortfolio

## Introduction

I have been in the SNHU Computer Science program since 2018 and prior to that I was stuck between whether I wanted to go back to school or not. I initially began college at San Jose State University as an undeclared major, only because engineering was heavily impacted. I decided in 2011 to join the Army and put my schooling on hold. When I got out of the military in 2018, I decided to try online classes rather than in person schooling so that I could still work full-time. Two years later, I am now on my way to finishing up my last class in the Computer Science program and finally earn my Bachelor's degree.

## Educational Reflection

During my time in the program, I learned a lot of vital information that will help me throughout my career as a computer programmer. For one, an attention to detail is one of the most important pieces of information to keep at the center of your head throughout your software development and also in all things in life. There have been quite a few times when I went to compile my code and it fails, only to find out it failed to compile due to a simple typo such as forgetting a semicolon somewhere. Attention to detail leads me right into my next point which is peer code reviews. At first I didn't really think much about how important code reviews code be until I had to actually do one in a class and never realized how many little mistakes I made or how complicated I made something so simple be. A code reivew acts in the same way as someone proofreading a paper for you and allowing a fresh set of eyes take a look at your work. Next comes testing, and with it the importance of why we test often and how important the role of tester can be. For one, it is important to test often so that if there is an error, there is a smaller chunk of code to look over to find the bug.
