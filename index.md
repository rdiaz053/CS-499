# CS-499 ePortfolio

## Introduction

I have been in the SNHU Computer Science program since 2018 and prior to that I was stuck between whether I wanted to go back to school or not. I initially began college at San Jose State University as an undeclared major, only because engineering was heavily impacted. I decided in 2011 to join the Army and put my schooling on hold. When I got out of the military in 2017, I decided to try online classes rather than in person schooling so that I could still work full-time. Two years later, I am now on my way to finishing up my last class in the Computer Science program and finally earn my Bachelor's degree.
