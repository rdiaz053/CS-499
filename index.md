## Introduction

I have been in the SNHU Computer Science program since 2018 and prior to that I was stuck between whether I wanted to go back to school or not. I initially began college at San Jose State University as an undeclared major, only because engineering was heavily impacted. I decided in 2011 to join the Army and put my schooling on hold. When I got out of the military in 2018, I decided to try online classes rather than in person schooling so that I could still work full-time. Two years later, I am now on my way to finishing up my last class in the Computer Science program and finally earn my Bachelor's degree.

## Educational Reflection

During my time in the program, I learned a lot of vital information that will help me throughout my career as a computer programmer. For one, an attention to detail is one of the most important pieces of information to keep at the center of your head throughout your software development and also in all things in life. There have been quite a few times when I went to compile my code and it fails, only to find out it failed to compile due to a simple typo such as forgetting a semicolon somewhere. Attention to detail leads me right into my next point which is peer code reviews. At first I didn't really think much about how important code reviews code be until I had to actually do one in a class and never realized how many little mistakes I made or how complicated I made something so simple be. A code reivew acts in the same way as someone proofreading a paper for you and allowing a fresh set of eyes take a look at your work. Next comes testing, and with it the importance of why we test often and how important the role of tester can be. For one, it is important to test often so that if there is an error, there is a smaller chunk of code to look over to find the bug. And to be the tester, you have to find ways to truly test the strength of your program and try to break it to find the flaws in our programs. All of this culminates into the entire Software Development Lifecycle which is a lot larger than I initially thought. It is really insane to think about the amount of logistics involved in the development of software. The development team isn't the only thing you have to worry about, you have to worry about what the client needs and making sure you translate those needs into directives for the rest of the team.

## Portfolio Summary

Every course I have taken throughout my time in the Computer Science program has had a different impact on my knowledge that I will need to prepare myself for a job in the industry. For instance, in the Computer Science Core-BS classes, we learned things such as the role that computer science plays in the technology industry (CS-200), how to design an Android app and create a simple user interface (IT-145), or how we can use SQL to access data from databases (DAD-220). These were only a few of the classes that began my journey through the Computer Science program, but they were important to me because they gave me an idea of how the rest of the program would go on to be. 

There was about five times as many classes to complete the program which is why I wanted to incorporate things into my artifacts and enhancements that came from classes early on in the Computer Science program in order to test my knowledge. In CS-330 we learned how to write code in order to render an object and my first enhancement comes directly from the CS-330 final project. I wanted to take the final project, change the object completely in order to give it a more detailed rendering with more textures than I had previously done. With my second enhancement, I took my final project from IT-145 and used my knowledge from CS-410 in order to reverse engineer the Python code into Visual Basic and use what I learned in CS-260 to create a data structure and sorting algorithms. For my final enhancement, I combined the dataset from my DAT-220 final with the knowledge I learned in CS-350 in order to use MongoDB and build an HTML interface so that users can interact with the data. 

The three of these projects don’t really relate with each other, other than the fact that with each enhancement, I tried to combine more than one classes information together to build a better product. This is important because our future careers depend on being able to adapt and being able to create something using a multitude of methods. 

## Preparing For The Future

This class and the entire Computer Science has prepared me for a future career as computer programmer but I do know that the program didn’t cover every single thing and there is always something more or new to learn. This has given me a baseline of where I am at and I can only go up from here. Prior to the Computer Science program, I already knew how to build computers and all of the hardware portions of it and this program gave me exactly what I needed which was an expansion of my knowledge into the software side of computers.
