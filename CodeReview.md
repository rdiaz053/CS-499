## Refinement Plan & Code Review

**Category One: Software Engineering/Design**

For this category, I want to work with my CS 330 Final Project. The artifact was written in C++ and used OpenGL to render the object in three-dimensional space. I originally create a chair object using OpenGL but it wasn’t very detailed and very basic. This time I wanted to make a drinking cup but increase the complexity of the model by adding other objects, textures, and lighting to simulate the environment. The enhancement will help demonstrate my ability to create more robust and efficient code.

**Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures**

For category two, I’ve chosen to work with my IT 145 Final Project, which consisted of either writing code for a simple authentication system or a simple animal monitoring system. I chose to write code for a simple authentication system in Java. The authentication system was able to read the inputs from the user and check to see if what the user has inputted matches a text file. My enhancement will be that I will rewrite the code in Visual Basic using Visual Studio so I can add GUI for the users. I will also create an array so that the data for the various types of animals can be stored and use a sorting function to improve speeds. This will show my ability to address security vulnerabilities and use algorithms in my code. 

**Category Three: Databases**

For this category, I’m choosing to work with the data file that was given to us for the DAT 220 Final Project. This data was filled with information about customers for a specific company that had both physical locations and an online store. For this, I wanted to create a MongoDB program that will allow the user to quickly search for information held within the data file. I actually learned how to do this in another class but would like to use the data file from this class instead to start fresh. This enhancement will show my ability to create MongoDB with an HTML interface.
